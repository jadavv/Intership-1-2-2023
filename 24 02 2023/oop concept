> Inheritence
    ~> Inheritence is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class
    ~> when a class derives from another class

@ Inheritence 

   1) single Inheritence  >  Single inheritance enables a derived class  to inherit properties from a single parent class
  2) multiple Inheritence > derived from more then one base class 
  3)multilevel Inheritence  > base class and the derived class are further  inherited  into the new derived class
  4)  hierarchical Inheritence > parent(base) class and two child(derived) classes
  5) hybrid Inheritence   >Inheritance consisting of multiple type of inheritence  is called hybrid inheritance
